# Project


## Brief
- These are the "Game Files" of the project
- Each Folder roughly corresponds to a particular Element
- Each Folder
- See [Project Layout Entry](../wiki/project-layout.md) if you need help understanding this
- ***NOTE!*** It is *very* important that you do not `move`, `delete`, or otherwise `modify` the **`project.godot`** file!
- Check each Folder for a `.md` file that explains what that folder does
