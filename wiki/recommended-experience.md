# Recommended Experience


## Motivation
- Docs provide **Why**, whereas Code provides **How**
- Need both to understand the project
- Additional commentary might appear in the file as `> Quoted Text`


## Reading
- Open the Project in Godot on the Right
- Open the Docs in GitHub on the Left
- As you come across an Aspect of the project, navigate to it in the Docs


## Editing
- Open the Docs in a Text Editor with **Syntax Highlighting** and **Previewing**
- **Syntax Highlighting** lets you check for errors as you type text
- **Previewing** lets you view the file in real-time while you edit it
- VS Code (Visual Studio Code, from *Microsoft*) is the most popular text editor as of `2020-12-19` and includes **markdown highlighting** and **markdown previewing** by default
