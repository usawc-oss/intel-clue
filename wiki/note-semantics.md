# Note Semantics

- FIXME


## About
- This is the use of particular names when titling sections
- this allows a machine to more easily parse the sections
- TODO




## Discussion
> - Should Notes use `Brief`, `About`, `Synopsis`, or `Overview` when talking about the introductory section of text?
> - Is `Brief` distinct from `About`? Does `About` hint at some higher-level context?
