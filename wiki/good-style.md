# Good Style



## File Sizes
- Ideally, a file should be under `500` lines
- Anything beyond this quickly becomes difficult to manage and reference from other documents



## Spacing
- Use only One `#` per file
- Use Four Newlines between `##`
- Use Two Newlines between `###`
- Do not use `####` or `#####`




## Outlines
- Avoid using Outlines, as these are poorly structured and hard to read
- Use outlines when drafting out new thoughts
- Convert them to Recursive Headers when possible instead




## Bullets
- Prefer bullets to Paragraphs
- Prefer standalone Statements to Continuations
- Prefer short statements to long expressions




## Naming
- Headers (Text following a `## `) produce a `url` when converted to markdown based on their spelling
- To avoid needing to type special control characters (such as `%2F`, `%20`, etc), it is simply easier to avoid using the following characters:
  - `(`, `)`, `+`, `!`, `?`, `'`, `,`, `:`
