## Where / How to Share Notes
- local docs build?
  - have wiki website attached to source code
- onenote
  - poor file linking
- git
  - not easy for technically non-proficient
  - is not common outside coding
- onedrive
  - has no *change versioning*, only *file versioning*
- Email or Chat
  - and why not notes?
  - why is this form of communication so much more common?

## How to Build a Creative Chamber
- Consider Austin and Peter
- Consider Looking Glass Studios
- Consider the Creation of an Environment wherein Contributors are Free to Express themselves
- Consider one in which the Group responds, and not a select Few
- Consider one in which change is encouraged, rather than monitored




## Tortoise Git
- Is it for Linux/Mac too?
- [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48028189/running-tortoisegit-in-mac-and-linux-using-wine)
- Just Windows
- [Source Code](https://gitlab.com/tortoisegit/tortoisegit)
- [Website](https://tortoisegit.org/)
- it integrates into the File Browser and Context Menu
- RabbitVCS exists for Linux
- [TortoiseGit Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaGIOuXmGB0)
- Does it fundamentally solve any of the problems of using git?
- true, it takes it out of the cli and puts it in the mouse-driven ui people will be familiar with
- but!
- this is only helpful for those proficient in the use of context menus and the file browser
- it does nothing else
- does not elucidate the process of using git
- it just dumps all the buttons on the user
- does make it easier, yes
- [Git 101 with TortoiseGit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZTPLrhLu-I)





## File Metadata and Git
- [What file metadata is preserved by Git?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45578579/what-file-metadata-is-preserved-by-git)
- [File Metadata](https://github.com/Dijji/FileMeta)
- [Are there any standards for storing repository metadata?](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-standards-for-storing-repository-metadata)




## XML and Git
- most office docs are zipped `xml` documents
- how well does git handle xml, epsecially **dirty**, **underspecified**, **deeply nested** `xml`?
- [How to handle xml/html in git feature branch workflow?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1681762/how-to-handle-xml-html-in-git-feature-branch-workflow)
- use a custom diff/merge tool

- [XML Diff and Merge](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/430001/xml-diff-and-merge)




## RabbitVCS
- exists for Linux
- [Source Code](https://github.com/rabbitvcs/rabbitvcs)
- [Website](http://rabbitvcs.org/)
- its pretty unstable, apparently




## Compensation Guide
- Especially for free software
- How do we go about operating whilst paying/funding for the appropriate efforts?
- are we large enough for this to be a concern?




## GUI Git
- What exists?
- And why are so many so poorly designed?
- `push`, `pull`, `stage`, `unstage` are not just a bunch of meaningless buttons - so stop grouping them together!
- IT makes no sense to put such power right next to each other without some strong semantic indication as to their difference and consequence
- Consider File Options in most editors - there are icons which accompany them - they are separated out - often *colored* differently
- [Git Client for Non-technical Users](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/52357/git-client-for-non-technical-users)
- NOT Sourcetree - horribly overcomplicated and messy layout
- NOT git cli - too much obfuscation
- [Is there a GUI client for Git? [closed]](https://askubuntu.com/questions/227554/is-there-a-gui-client-for-git)
- [UnGit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit)
  - [Ungit introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkBVAi3oKvo)
  - very nicely done
  - possibly cannot use at work due to using NodeJS
  - possibly not useful for many applications because of limited diffing
    - disappointed this is not made bigger
  - but for free, not bad
  - very pretty - WorkTree operations handled well
  - But EditTree *not* handled well - more work needed
  - still the best one I have seen
- [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/)
  - maybe too many buttons
- [GitG](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg)
  - Integrates with Gnome's File System
  - [Browsing in gitg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CZLULiL4Hw)
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
  - pretty.
  - definitely less crowded than SourceTree
  - but still makes same mistake of not making the tree more visual
  - still, does at least try
  - pricing may be too much
- [EasyGit](https://people.gnome.org/~newren/eg/)
  - really more just fixes to the terminal
  - not updated in a long time
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/)
  - [My Favorite Git App: Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOEAOZ0wMn4)
  - Mac and Windows
  - various graphical (mouse-driven) interactions
- [XKCD: Git](https://xkcd.com/1597/)
  - probably the best advice, actually
- [XKCD: Git Commit](https://xkcd.com/1296/)
  - another, entirely too honest depiction




## Task Management
- GitHub/GitLab Issues
- Wikis
- **Microsoft Planner**
- Microsoft Outlook
- Best Practices?





## Books Like PeopleWare
- Emphasize this kind of development/production/work ethic/behavior
- need people to be **mindful**




## Cathedral or Bazaar
- Remember [*The Cathedral and the Bazaar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)
- I do not want to create this *anywhere*
- We need for people to be *constantly* using a resource, contributing to that resource, and feeling ownership of it/empowerment through it






## Learning
- Much of my resources draw from YouTube
- Which is inaccessible at CSL
- Same for many other websites




## Graphical Version Control
- What is truly needed for this?
- What things are really needed?
- And what should the process of reconciling changes look like?
- Is it enough to have plaintext diff's for multimedia files?
  - (pdf, unity, etc)
- Is there a simpler interface to git than just git itself?
- IS there some application which focuses heavily on *process* and making that process as *explicit* and *obvious* as possible?





## Git and SVN
- Consider how SVN serializes everything to *the* filetree
- Consider that Git keeps the 
- Consider these *Trees*:
  - *FileTree*
  - *EditTree*
  - *WorkTree*
  - *ProjectTree*
  - *ProcessTree*
- The *FileTree* is what exists on the user's machine at the end of the day
- Sometimes special files/folders can be included, but generally you want to keep this clean
- The *EditTree* is an abstract thing, associating changes to *Files* with *Time*
- Git stores its *EditTree* in a Database of Objects in the `.git` folder in the root of a versioned repository
- SVN stores its *EditTree* in parallel with its *WorkTree*, each branch being a different root-level folder
- The *WorkTree* is how people semantically split up work. Often takes the form of *Forks* or *Branches*
- Git builds these trees through *Commits*
- The *ProjectTree* is the layout of the Project
- Git preserves this as the *FileTree*, whereas SVN modifies the *FileTree* to first be the *WorkTree*, and then the *ProjectTree*
- What if we could have all of these trees serialized as separate *FileTrees*, but *linked together* using shortcuts?
- The advantages are that these trees can then be explored natively using the *File Browser*, as opposed to custom tools
- Or if we used standard formats that other applications could use, such as `json`
- Lastly is the *ProcessTree*, which concerns the transformation of one file into another file. Consider the Process of converting an edited file into untracked, untracked into tracked, tracked into committed, committed into pushed, pushed into merged, and merged into deployed
- Seeing this *ProcessTree* made explicit might help greatly
- Example: Two File Browsers side-by-side, moving files from one to the other is a way of making the process explicit and visible to the user







## Godot Hosting
- [READ THIS](https://gitlab.com/menip/godot-multiplayer-tutorials)





## DSW Wiki Features
- Self Hosted MediaWiki
- MKDocs (`MD`) Wiki
- Build to `pdf`
- Use `python` to inspect/refactor
- Link to each other constantly
- Change link style to bold
- Heavy use of semantic linking
- Basic embedded search bar? (`js`)
- Inform with metadata (let search query off of this)
- See other notes
- build one gigantic pdf from separate markdown files?
- Name Pages/Files compositionally - not enough to just call a page "Aardvark"
- Example: WhatIsAnAardvark
- Example: ExampleAardvark









## Just Do the Damned Job
- Why the hell do I waste my time with this nonsense?
- I am being a fool
- I should just do my damned job
- Use GitHub
- Put your fricking notes up on a wiki
- Use no frontmatter
- See if CI/CD can touch the wiki - put your checkers there
- Add plan for next 3 months
- Add checkins on teams
- Add file sync schedule





## Wiki Recursion Scale
- what is the appropriate scale of recursion?
  - (`#`) Section?
  - (`##`) SubSection?
  - (`.md`) File?
- what should be kept on a single page?
  - should FrontMatter be used?
    - Who should provide this?
    - should it be `YAML`?
    - or should it be part of the page content as `md`?
- has implications for writing tags
  - if file, put tags in the FrontMatter





## Strict Wiki Guidelines
- No Outlines
  - Except for Trees?
- No Tables
  - Except for comparisons?
- No Markup
  - Except for Links?
- No SubSections
  - Beyond (`###`)
- No Long Paragraphs
- No Big Words without Definition
  - same for acronyms
- maybe not strict
  - but do help/encourage people towards using better forms
  - also need some definitions to talk about schemas, layouts, etc
- No Folders
  - Bad for Linking
  - Use Search Instead





## Reflective Wiki Pages
- Contents
  - basic stuff, but can be total (tree) or recursive (delegate)
- Dictionary
  - eliminate multiple words for same concept
  - link to when possible
  - compare against (for scripting/cleanup)
- Structure
  - what does the wiki look like?
  - help people navigate it
  - (hyperphysics?)
- Tags
  - one page per tag
  - another way to navigate
  - make dates into tags as well
- Tags through notes
  - put tags in notes
  - scripts then adds pages with tags to tag pages
- Reflective Tags
  - tags not explicitly stated, but instead determined by the system
  - example: NoTags, EmptyFile, BigFile, CrowdedFile, MessyNote, UnderLinked, OverLinked, Listicle, etc
- Page on Names
  - How to write new filenames
- Page on Style
  - how to write good notes
- FileNamesGeneratedByRelation
  - Big names like this
- History/Edit Pages?
  - Instead of just Git, use this too
  - serialize to Human Text (markdown) what changes happened when
  - scale of recursion?
  - probably global - can specify for individual pages later
- Link-To/Pull-Text-From Emails?
  - since so much conversing happens on email
  - may be wise to specify where a page came from
- Schema Pages?
  - use markdown to write these
  - these show how to write a page a certain way
  - so expected features/styles under blocks/etc






## Link Style
- User or Page?
  - Consider use of `@` in semi-social apps (such as Teams) to tag a user
    - could list these on the `User:USERNAME` page under a "mentions" section
- Local or Global?
  - How to distinguish between?
    - Local: Link is on This Page
    - Global: Link is on Separate Page
    - use `@` symbol?
      - for local
      - so [@section](#section)
- Internal or External?
  - How to distinguish between?
  - ðŸ”— Unicode Link Symbol?
    - ([source](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f517/browsertest.htm)
    - this is just the "link" symbol
    - unicode rejects the "external link" symbol
    - [Why isn't the external link symbol in Unicode?](https://dafoster.net/articles/2018/11/24/why-isnt-the-external-link-symbol-in-unicode/)
    - looks like:
      ```
      â”Œâ”€â¬€
      â””â”€â”˜
      ```
      ([Unicode box drawing diagonals](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58901745/unicode-box-drawing-diagonals))  
      ([Box-drawing character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character))
    - Could just use a [Diagonal Arrow](https://unicode-table.com/en/sets/arrow-symbols/) instead
    - this becomes tedious to type
    - we could probably append this through scripting





## A DSW KM Toolkit
- UnGit
- MKDocs
- A Text Editor
- GitHub
- `Source` (MD) Plaintext Docs Folder
- `Bin` (HTML, PDF) Rendered docs as local website
- `Scripts` (JS, PY) For cleaning the `Source`
- Platform?
  - Online?
    - Github?
  - Self?
    - Gitea?
    - MediaWiki?
- Scripting?
  - [MicroMark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) (and associated tooling)?
- may be better to put all of these scripts in a separate project
  - and allow dsw's project to INCLUDE them
  - allow others to use these scripts?
  - what to call them?
  - ReflectiveWiki?
- [Docs-as-code tools](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_docs_as_code.html)
- MKDocs
  - [has many themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes)
- Jekyll
  - [Implementing a dark theme in jekyll](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52880620/implementing-a-dark-theme-in-jekyll)
  - [Implementing Dark Mode to Your Jekyll Site](https://francisoliver.dev/blog/dark-mode-in-jekyll)
- Lektor
  - this is fascinating
  - FOSS, CMS
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/lektor/lektor)
  - possibly easier to use for the less technically inclined
- SublimeText
  - This has macros, is not moddable (ease the NEC security people)
  - syntax support, somewhat popular/easy to use
  - possible concern because it's one guy
- Renderers
  - [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is FOSS, but may not be as pretty - can use the following
  - [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) - FOSS, do donate
  - [Prince](https://www.princexml.com/) is very expensive, but probably affordable for DSW
  - [wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf) - FOSS
- [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/)
  - interesting, albeit maybe too much for DSW?
  - dunno, editor is nice
  - takes on a `Book > Chapter > Page` Model
  - maybe not useful for wikis, but certainly elegant
  - *very* clean interface
  - nice use of breadcrumbs and navigational aids
  - WYSIWYG interface may be more friendly to DSW





## Enhanced Plaintext Search
- consider limited tools available at DSW
- Serialize search metadata to a md page
- use this to aid in `ctrl f` search
- list out all sorts of stuff per page
- need to be careful, eliminate overlap as much as possible





## Platforms for the Wiki
- Azure has its own "wikis" as well: [Provisioned wikis vs. published code as a wiki](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/provisioned-vs-published-wiki)
- GitHub Wiki
- GitHub Repo + Jekyll/MKdocs






## What to Put in the FrontMatter
- Maybe wise to put *some* things in here
- Instead of in the document
- You can use Regex on Windows in PowerShell: [Powershell: The many ways to use regex](https://powershellexplained.com/2017-07-31-Powershell-regex-regular-expression/)
- cmd has limited support: [How to use Windows Command Line Regular Expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15537616/how-to-use-windows-command-line-regular-expressions)





## Too Much Magic
- I don't want the pages to become too magical for people to use and manage
- as an example: Automatic Link Generation
- For awhile I have thought this would be a friendly feature
- Users type names `JustLikeThis`
- and if the page `JustLikeThis.md` exists, it gets linked
- but there are some problems with this
  1. It isn't immediate
  2. It isn't included in any common Markdown Syntax Checkers
- its also not apparent what's happening, as this is not default behavior
- Can I expect people to type using normal markdown link syntax?
  - (`[Text](link)`)
- Is it wise to separate **Page Source** from **Page Display**?
  - consider how one can navigate between pages using links when it is **Displayed**, but they cannot when it is in **Source**, unless their editor supports such
- [Just a Test](JustATest)
  - If the document loads, after `ctrl + lclick`, then your editor supports source-linking
- see also: [Including Content](#including-content)





## Including Content
- How do we indicate such?
- What provides a Full Picture and When?
- Consider these Page Elements:
  - Navigation Bar
  - Bread Crumbs
  - Section Includes/Quotes
- Consider that AsciiDoc makes a very clear distinction between *Consuming* a page and *Creating* a page
- Consider that Word and other WYSIWYG editors do not
- Now consider that AsciiDoc uses Links to Include content, meaning it will always be fetched, but will never be included in the source itself
- What if we had some mechanism for saying we wish to include certain content, but to also have it included in the source by default?
- We could always copy/paste the text, but it might fall out-of-date
- So, it may make sense to include some `Update` *thing*, that specifies a section in the document to be updated
- maybe even under a particular heading
- See: [Means of Specifying Content to Update](#means-of-specifying-content-to-update)






## Means of Specifying Content to Update


### FrontMatter
- Hides it from the user
- Makes it harder for less-technically inclined to understand
```md
---
update:
- source: "PublicPlumbingFixtures.md/#us-fire-hydrants"
  target: "#fire-hydrants"
---

## Fire Hydrants
![This image from the Public Plumbing article](FileName.png)
- This Text from the Public Plumbing article
```


### Appropriate Image Notation
- In out own script checker, check to see if an image link is actually a page link
```md
## Fire Hydrants
![This content from the Public Plumbing article](PublicPlumbingFixtures.md/#us-fire-hydrants)
```


### Section Tag
- using the words `updates from:` and a following link, we can check for this and update
- a little magical though - requires users to know they need to do this, and can't just copy/paste the content
- (alternatively, could just have the scripts check for copied text and link it themselves - possibly note in a "linked texts" file)
  - ((thought this can get to be *pretty* hard to handle if they start making edits to it))
    - ((how do we decide that two sections are similar enough?))
    - ((do we allow users to edit either one to affect both?))
```md
## Fire Hydrants
- updates from: [This text does not matter](PublicPlumbingFixtures.md/#us-fire-hydrants)
![This image from the Public Plumbing article](FileName.png)
- This Text from the Public Plumbing article
```

## Expected Tag Density
- explicit
- consider on e621, that some images have almost no tags, whereas others have almost too many tags
- consider how we might estimate the detail of a picture
- consider how we might estimate how many tags can be derived from an image
- consider how many tags in total exist

## JIOCus
- need better name
- 2020-11-26T14:19:00-05
- "End of the World 2022"?
- 2024?
- Broader focus on RECIPES
- *Newsweek: 600 Reasons to Not Trust China*
  - emphasis on **S**ocial, **C**ultural aspects
  - possibly **I**ntelligence
- needs to consider full spectrum of RECIPES
- needs to consider inner workings of countries
- needs to more deeply consider inner workings of a JIOC
- better UI - emphasize focus on estimated capabilities of
  - US, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, EU, etc
  - developing not just technologies, but techniques and logistics for
    - massive change, incremental decay, etc
    - why EU/US/Canada?
      - because this determines how well prepared they are
      - whether other countries know about those tech levels and how they might respond
- need ui to manage
  - incoming reports
  - focus/balance of resources (inside JIOC)

## Elements and Domains
- what is a title?
- what makes the title distinct from the content?
- consider this note at this moment in time:
```
- the "title" is itself text, a *content* item (text)
- this gets at the notion of recursion, and subspaces, and environments
- the text following `## ` and preceding `\n` is said to exist within its own special environment, with certain consequences
  - the text becomes hyperlinked, accessible with `[](#)` notation
  - the text is presented differently









## Impressive Stuff

### [Dialogic v0.5 - Indentation magic and branches - Devlog 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrTyWy2TJOM)
- done
- Consider the creation of a new language atop another language
- consider the features to improve and make pleasant the process of speaking in this language
- consider the limitation and implications of this language - the difficulty of using it as a general organizational language - especially for cutscenes, custom events, etc
- consider the forced limitation of its use within a 2D scene
- consider the requirement for demarcating the end of closures with an element

## Conversation as Procedural Content
- consider the use of Godot's ~~*ConceptGraph*~~ *ProtonGraph* for 3D shape generation
- it uses a sequence of boxes with arrows between them to generate such things
- what if we appropriated them for use as a conversation system?
- and have the conversation shape some *N* dimensional *topic* space?
- However...
- this is all *in-editor*
- and I want something that can be used at *run-time*
- and in *multiplayer*
- this presents problems....
- I wonder how *HungryProton* developed *ConceptGraph*
- if he developed it as a *Game*, then I might be able to appropriate it and turn it into a multiplayer-networked thing

- Setup Azure to Deploy Godot
- Setup External Godot Projects to supply
  - proper code/docs
    - good style motivation
    - example workflow
  - role management
  - board game tools/helpers
    - how to help making board games in godot easier?
    - consider defining a board
  - admin tools
    - view all player panels
    - view player performance
  - argument construction
    - nodes
    - node relationships
    - build off of godot visual graph editor
    - [ProtonGraph](https://github.com/protongraph/protongraph)
    - (is this necessary?)
- find where to put docs
  - want a wiki-like system
  - want place where isnt forgotten/deleted
  - preferably public and shared

  - looks like nobody uses this
  - also looks like no one uses the onenote location either
  - I wonder how well informed people are of these tools
