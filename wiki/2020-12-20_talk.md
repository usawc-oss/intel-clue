# `2020-12-20` Talk


## About
- *ConceptGraph* as good example project
  - [ProtonGraph](https://github.com/protongraph/protongraph)
- [*Among Us*](#among-us)
- [Focus on Button Pushing](#buttons)
- [Mouse Tracker](#mouse-tracker)
- Emphasis on [Deep Ontology](#deep-ontology) or [Shallow Reusable](#shallow-ontology)?
  - [Discussion](#deep-or-shallow)


## *Among Us*
- (move to Design Section)
- Lot of *HCI* ideas
- Pop-Up Menus
- In-Game Learning


## Buttons
- (For first demo)
- Synchronizing (RPC)
- Event Triggering (Signals)
- Tool Tips (Docs)
- Effect (Sound)


## Mouse Tracker
- Color
- Name
- Position
- Implement Later, Likely to be very distracting
- Esp. regarding lack of separate screens
- Need a way of expressing player differences
- need to share screens on some matters


## Deep or Shallow
- Both try to help the user in different ways
- Does the Ontology help non-programmers?
- How will people modify the game?


## Deep Ontology
- Emphasis on Contextualized Elements
- Typical of Java/Big Engineering Projects
- Can turn bad if using dependencies
- Can be ok with use of Exports (Inspector)
- More flexible but also more broken-up


## Shallow Ontology
- Emphasis on reusable components across projects
- Typical of Smaller Projects/Python
- Few Dependencies per Object
- Not as flexible
