# Raw Note Import


## About
- Notes taken from my physical notebook and rendered here
- Context: Working on *Intel-Game*, most of these notes concern programming and design of said game
- Todo: Book 4
- Todo: Book 5


## Template
```md
## Title
- Book N Page N
- Date
- Details
```


## Expressing Automation
- Book 5 Page 04
- 2020-12-28
- The problem with MS Power Automate
- MS does not express the "default mechanism" of any of its apps in it
- Result is there is no template to go off of for minor adjustments
- Consider how man behaviors in Outlook are hard-coded
- It is not desirable behavior, as we now have to work around these rules
- As opposed to making slight adjustments
- It also hides what logic Outlook is using underneath
- It is more powerful and immediately useful to people to express things within a consistent, accessible language
- Hence, in this project, for anything involving behavior, use some consistent, easily modifiable language as opposed to hard-scripting
- See also: Unreal Engine default mechanics
- Unreal includes a large palette of "drag-and-drop" gameplay
- This allows non-technical users to very quickly create and modify games
- And use a consistent language for describing the behavior within that language


## Godot Options
- Book 5 Page 08
- 2021-01-03
- Scripting Via
  - VisualScript?
    - Visual, albeit Large
    - Not recommended, hard to express things
  - GDScript?
    - Short, albeit Text
    - Not recommended for non-technical users
  - BTScript?
    - Short, Visual, albeit Obscure
    - Defined by GDScript, but presents Visual layer
    - Most preferred
- Extending Via
  - All-In-One
    - Default pattern, describe everything as part of the same package 
  - Plugin?
    - Make a Godot Plugin to the Editor, create a new editing environment
  - Built-In?
    - Export multiple unique apps that talk to one another
    - Mostly uses `tscn`


## Folders as Objects
- Book 5 Page 15
- 2021-01-07
- Context: `CLI`'s and `REPL`'s
- (`CLI`: Command Line Interface)
- (`REPL`: Read Eval Print Loop)
- Traverse Object Trees like File Trees
- Inspect File Trees like Object Trees
- Example: `Git` Version Control System
  - `git pull`, `git add`, `git checkout`
  - All sub-objects of `git` object
- Can treat Path as a Stack


## Seeing Everyone Else
- Book 5 Page 17
- 2021-01-08
- On the Game Board
- Want to show other players' abilities and hands
- Make the *DHS* its own *role*


## Interface
- Book 5 Page 25
- 2021-01-14
- Drawing of Game Window
- (List) List of Threats on the Left (1/4 of screen)
- (Map) Map with Risks on the Right (3/4 of screen)
- Map is an importable image
- Risks are positions on the Map
- Risks can be added by a user
- Risks belong to a Threat
- Risks display on the Map
- Risks are listed under their Threat in the List
- Threats are ordered alphabetically in the List
- Risks can be dragged from one Threat to Another
- Threats can be Renamed
- Risks can be Renamed
- Risks have an Image and Description
- NOTE: This is *not* the Risk-Editor screen


## Shower Thoughts
- Book 5 Page 27
- 2021-01-14
- Events
  - The Instructor can set these in setup
  - Admin can manually trigger them
  - Can be triggered by actions, amounts, rounds, etc
- BT's (Behavior Trees)
  - Use these instead of plain scripting
- Calculations (???)
- Command Cards
  - Allow J3, J2, DNI to express themselves
  - Others can use these cards to structure their own cards on the board
- Networking
  - Add Card (User)
  - Add Card (Board)
  - Add User (Game)
- Url-Based Sharing
  - `?game=12345`
  - `&user=abcdef`
- Don't use passwords
  - (Too complicated for the time-being)
- Game Data (Text, Images, Scenes)
- Generic/Stock Images (For quick-setup games)
- Fix Multiplayer
- Roles (???)
- Start Date and Incrementation
  - Set this in setup
  - Give sense of scale to players
- Director Cards
  - What would these look like?
- Card Attributes (Need to List these)
- Export Zip?
  - Discourage people from editing these files outside an editor
- Download Zip?
  - Let users locally save their game
- Collate Notes
  - (From notebooks)
- Built-In Voice-Chat?
  - Dynamic Rooms
  - Prevent complex setup
  - But may not be secure
- Data
  - How much is there?
  - And where do we want to keep it?
  - And how do we manage and share it?
  - (Esp. Versioning, prevent incompatibilities, but also enable backsupport)
  - (Esp. consider Core versus Instance game)
  - Core: Core logic, behavior
  - Instance: Modifications/Extensions to Core, enable particular scenarios
  - Do we want to instantiate Core Logic within Instance Saves?
  - Or can we expect Core to be constant?
  - Maybe specify a version of Core to expect
- Docs
  - Remove `YAML` sections from notes, write all as `markdown`


## Save Folder Layout (Game)
- Book 5 Page 28
- 2021-01-14
- Temporary, may not be accurate
- ```yaml
  GameSave.Name.zip:
    Game/:
      Game.png        # Cover Image (Shown on match browser)
      Game.tscn       # Title, Description, Rules, Rounds, etc
    Events/:
      Event.Name/:
        Event.tscn    # Triggers, Pointers, Text, Script
        Event.png     # Image
      ...
    Map/:
      Map.png         # Forms the Game Board
      Map.tscn        # Risk Locations
    Threats/:
      Threat.Name/:
        Threat.png    # Cover Image on Cards
        Threat.tscn   # Description, Possibly Capabilities (Future)
      ...
    Risks/:
      Risk.Name/:
        Risk.png      # Card image
        Risk.tscn     # Parent Threat, Attributes
      ...
    Roles/:
      Role.Name/:
        Role.png      # Cover image on cards
        Role.tscn     # Description, Hand, Hand-Rules
      ...
    Abilities:
      Ability.Name/:
        Ability.png   # Cover Image (Cards)
        Ability.tscn  # Description, Attributes, Rules
      ...
  ```
- How many kinds of saves do we want?


## Serialization Concerns
- Book 5 Page 29
- 2021-01-24
- ~~Players (names, roles, IP addresses)~~
- Threats (Name, Location, Picture, Description)
- Events (Name, Trigger, Effect, Picture, Description)
- Map (Picture, Risks, Cards)
- Turn (Don't! Make this Asynchronous)
- ~~Players as singletons~~
  - When would we register these?
  - We will want more than one instance of these
  - No reason to only instantiate one
- Game as Singleton (easy addressing of components?)
- Game (Name, Description, Cover-Image, Start-Date, Module-Semantics)
- Players (Name, Role, Hand)


## Maintenance Cost
- Book 4 Page 11
- Date
- (Especially of Wikis, note-systems, and databases)
- There is a lot that has to be done
- Biggest cost is integration
- Software Updates
- Security Patches
- Server Subscriptions
- User Access, User Privacy
- Navigation (Automated Dir construction)
- Sanitation (Content)
- May be wiser to use static pages
- But static pages say nothing about their scripting
- [We should use some form of docs exporter instead of separate docs?](https://github.com/eh-jogos/eh_DocsExporter/wiki)
- We should not use in-code to build documentation, this is not useful or appropriate


## Degrees of Link Externality
- Book 4 Page 48
- 2020-12-23
- Website > File > Section
- `army.mil` > `army.mil/path/to/file.txt` > `army.mil/path/to/file.txt#the-section`
- When written in document, indicate how external it is
  - To Other Website: Show Arrow icon
  - To Other Page in This Website: Show Doc icon
  - To Section in This Page: Regular Link (No icon)


## Intel-Clue Cards
- Book 4 Page 46
- 2020-12-23
- (Drawings)
- Card Types
  - Reports
  - Operations
  - Deception Operations
  - Adversaries
- Card Back
  - Words: I.N.T.E.L. *clue*
  - Picture: Magnifying Glass
  - Top, Bottom Edges: Type of Card
- Risk Card 1
  - Drawing: Card
  - Title: "Nuclear Launcher" along Top
  - Image: "Hazmat Man with Uranium" below Title
  - Confidence Bar: 5 stars in a row below Image
  - Confidence Text: "Probable" below Confidence Bar
  - Description: "..." below Confidence Text
  - Severity Meter: Green to Red Bar below Description
  - Severity Text: "Severe" below Severity Meter
  - Threat Type Icon: Above Top Right of Card, a picture of "Nuclear" with own color
  - Threat Type Text: Below Threat Type Icon, "NUKE"
  - Supporting Intel Icon: Along Right Edge of Card, Icon for "Satellite"
  - Supporting Intel Text: "GEOINT" below Supporting Intel Icon
  - Supporting Intel Intensity: "x5" beside Supporting Intel Text
- Risk Card 2
  - Drawing: Card
  - Image: Satellite Dish
  - Title: "Listening Post" under Image
  - Description under Title
  - Confidence: 5 Stars in a row under Description
  - Severity: Green to Red Bar under Confidence
  - Attributes: Intel Type, Value, Along Right Edge of Card
  - Comments:
    - This is an "aggregate" card, it cannot exist in reality
    - Instead, it combines many other cards and redraws itself each round with new information
    - Attributes are supporting evidence of the Risk existing
    - Attributes are round tokens with their own color, value, and image

## Kinds of Saves
- Book ??? Page ???
- 2020-??-??
- Several Kinds of Saves
  - Modules
    - Files used in Games
    - Example: `DHS Role`
    - Is shared between many games
  - Games
    - Example: `Baltic Brawl`
    - Should only store a reference to its modules
  - Sessions
    - Adds Players, Game-State
    - Should only store a reference to its game
- Question of Instances
  - Should these save files create instances of their referenced parents?
    - Consider a Session
      - Should a Session store instances of `DHS` even though it only references it?
        - (Includes Description, Image, Script)
    - Consider a Game
      - Should it include an instance of `DHS`?
        - (Includes Description, Image, Script)
