# Misc Resources Notes





## How to Structure Game Data
- ***EXTREMELY BAD*** - excellent example of an **ANTIPATTERN**
- just... don't do this.
- *Never* mix **code** and **data** together - *always* keep them separate




## Better Practices
- capture player input as a Vector3
  - call "intention vector"
- super short scripts
  - orient around lifetime functions
- docs
  - everything must be commented
  - total structure must be drawn and talked about
  - progress must be tracked
- export yer stuff
  - always
