# MS Office Notes




## Teams
- Creates a SharePoint
- Tries to hide it
- SharePoint has "Navigation Pane" - is just links
- Important
  - "Site Contents" - just the file tree
  - "Conversations" - the mailing list
  - "Notebook" - a shared OneNote
  - "Pages" - the "website" - notable are "wiki" pages

## SharePoint
- [Gordon's Tech How can I create a local copy of a Sharepoint wiki?](https://tech.kateva.org/2009/06/how-can-i-create-local-copy-of.html)
- [SharePoint StackExchange How to add wiki pages to web-part page?](https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/42933/how-to-add-wiki-pages-to-web-part-page)
- [How to build an awesome Knowledge Base Wiki in SharePoint Online using modern pages](https://sharepointmaven.com/how-to-build-an-awesome-knowledge-base-wiki-in-sharepoint-online-using-modern-pages/)
- Doesn't even link things
- *Arduous* Links
- Has Versioning.
- *Cannot* download files




## Planner
- (*waaaayyyyY* too many doodads)
- (Need to limit how and why and in what way we want people to use this thing)
- Elements
  - Columns
  - **Cells**
  - Tags
  - Checklists
  - **Comments**
  - Statuses
  - **Due Dates**
  - **Assignees**
  - Descriptions
  - Tags
  - Importance
- Conflicting Elements
  - Tags, Columns, Statuses
    - these all express the same - or potentially the same - thing
  - Cells, Checklists
    - why cant cells reference other cells?
  - Descriptions, Comments
    - Is the description not simply the leading comment?
    - can edit descriptions, but not comments
- Think about this like a graph, multiple domains that intersect
- Adding all these abstraction devices just makes it complicated






## Webpages
- Help
  - GitHub Link
  - SharePoint Navigation
  - Org Chart
