# Serving Over NIPR






## About
- Need to do an in-person playtest
- Carlisle Barracks has both the Library (Internet) and Collins Hall (NIPRnet)
- Cannot serve the game locally (no Python to serve the `html` export)
- Can try testing if powershell or batch can serve a javascript page
- Can try using web services
  - https://itch.io
  - https://gotm.io
- Neither of these are available from NIPRnet
  - They time out too quickly
  - But they are available from Internet
- Cannot run batch files, they are blocked
- *Can* access the console, *can* run most things there
- Do not have access to `cscript`
  - Again, blocked
- Could try hosting just static html on SharePoint/GoogleCloud to see if that works
  - (Know that these two are available on NIPRnet)

- [fully encrypted git repositories with gcrypt](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt/)
- [Git Secret](https://git-secret.io/)

### Notes
- Instead of encrypting the whole folder, it may be better to do so on a per-file basis
- Yes, this means that the structure of a project will be visible
- But, this also means you can still check stuff in and out on a per-file basis, rather than overwrite everything each time







## Local Remote Git

### Refs
- "git remote is local"
- [How to add a local repo and treat it as a remote repo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10603671/how-to-add-a-local-repo-and-treat-it-as-a-remote-repo)
- [How do you use “git --bare init” repository?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7632454/how-do-you-use-git-bare-init-repository?noredirect=1&lq=1)

> ### [Matt Sanders](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/34507038/revisions)
> If your goal is to keep a local copy of the repository for easy backup or for sticking onto an external drive or sharing via cloud storage (Dropbox, etc) you may want to use a bare repository. This allows you to create a copy of the repository without a working directory, optimized for sharing.
> 
> For example:
> ```bash
> $ git init --bare ~/repos/myproject.git
> $ cd /path/to/existing/repo
> $ git remote add origin ~/repos/myproject.git
> $ git push origin master
> ```
> Similarly you can clone as if this were a remote repo:
> ```bash
> $ git clone ~/repos/myproject.git
> ```

### Terms
- AWS: Amazon Web Services, a cheap platform for running live services
- GIT: FOSS Version Control System, currently the most popular for software development
