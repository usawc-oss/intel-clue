# TODO



- (regarding the wiki)
- ((Also need todo regarding project))

## Git Repo Organization
- Should really get one for CSL
- `usawc-csl`
- Check Apps-Div and DTI to see what exists
- Check with NEC to see what's allowed
```yaml
usawc-csl/:
  readme/:      # Intro Repo to whole org
  wiki/:        # Notes
  intel-game/:  # Rename, this project
```
