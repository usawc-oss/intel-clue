## Sunday Morning JIOCus Notes
- (2020-12-13T10:00:00-05:00)

### Subordinate structure
- Pick one ccmd to model
- Staff try to answer questions
- Urgency depends on command
- Joint interop is poor
- Best sim: chaos
- Intel officers at ccmd never do actually collect - instead search
- All about how you ask questions - dont ask what, but explain why
- Explain importance level
- Designated liason
- Process of requesting info
- RFI manager
- Satellite hijacking (channels)
- How to find these hijackers?
- Geolocation generates a list of questions
- Know time of day, general location
- Find legitimate transmitters
- Could also be accidental

### NJOICs and Crises
- High level compartments, classification
- Often only 1 person knows
- Affects urgency of requests, access to resources (satellites)

### Deception
- Common
- Everyone does it

### Introduce Bureaucracy
- Few will go into jioc
- Instead, most will interact with it

### Data gets Back
- Never raw data
- Often maps, diagrams, paragraph

### Aim of Game
- How to ask questions
- What is everyones roles (CIA, NSA, MIA, DHS, etc)
