# Department of Strategic Wargaming Intelligence Games


## Brief
- A small repository for any Intelligence Elective games at the *Army War College*
- Since this repo is *private*, any notes are added to the `wiki/` directory, as opposed to the *wiki* tab
- Contributors should check the [Getting Started](wiki/getting-started.md) page
- If you need help, consult the `readme.md` in each sub-folder
- These are plaintext files that explain what something is
- In general, associate `.md` with your text editor, it makes it easier to read these files



## Elements

### `.git/`
- The folder for handling version control
- Hidden by default, you can find it by enabling "show hidden files" in the File Explorer
- It is very important that you do not `modify`, `move`, or `delete` this folder, as `git` will break

### `intel-game/`
- The Game Files for this project

### `wiki/`
- Notes, Information, and other helpful bits

### `resources/`
- Binary or otherwise unrelated Files
